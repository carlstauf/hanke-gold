## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. **AI-Powered Signal Engine**
*   **Real-Time Analysis**: Scrapes and analyzes headlines from major financial sources (Reuters, Bloomberg, Kitco) using Gemini 2.5.
*   **Quantitative Scoring**: Generates a sentiment score (-1.0 to 1.0) based on weighted factors: Inflation, USD Strength, Real Rates, and Geopolitics.
*   **Recency Weighting**: Algorithms automatically weight news from the last 12 hours 50% higher than older data to capture immediate market shifts.

### 2. **Macro Stress Test Lab**
*   **Generative Simulation**: Toggle "Black Swan" events (e.g., *Fed Pivot*, *Global Conflict*, *Hyperinflation*) to run synthetic scenarios.
*   **Impact Projection**: The LLM hallucinates realistic news headlines and market reactions based on your selected shock vectors, allowing for "What-If" analysis.

### 3. **Robust Live Market Data**
*   **Region-Agnostic Feeds**: Implements a cascading price fetch strategy (Coinbase → Binance US → CryptoCompare → CoinGecko) to ensure US users and global users always see a live tick.
*   **High Frequency Polling**: Updates spot prices every 5 seconds.

### 4. **Institutional UX/UI**
*   **Terminal Aesthetic**: Built with a "Dark Carbon" theme, `JetBrains Mono` typography, and strict grid layouts inspired by Bloomberg Terminals.
*   **Rate-Limit Optimized**: Features a sequential "Waterfall" data fetching pipeline with exponential backoff to respect free-tier API limits.

## 🧩 Architecture

### Data Pipeline
To prevent `429 Resource Exhausted` errors on the Gemini Free Tier, AuQuant uses a **Sequential Waterfall** strategy on boot:

1.  **Boot Phase**: Displays a splash screen (2.5s).
2.  **Phase 1 (High Priority)**: Fetches and analyzes live news for the Daily Signal.
3.  **Phase 2 (Delay)**: Waits 2-4 seconds to clear rate limit buckets.
4.  **Phase 3 (Low Priority)**: Fetches historical price context.

### Price Service
The `priceService.ts` module uses a fallback strategy to avoid CORS issues and Region Blocking:
1.  **Priority 1**: Coinbase API (PAXG/USD) - Works globally, fast, CORS-friendly.
2.  **Priority 2**: Binance US - For US IP addresses.
3.  **Priority 3**: CryptoCompare - Backup aggregator.
